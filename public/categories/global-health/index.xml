      <description>An illustration of Ebola stigma and treatment, drawn by the CDC.
Co-written with Christopher Cai, a friend and clinical trial coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Amid much fanfare, an international team of researchers recently reported the final results of the first successful Ebola vaccine trial.
While we should celebrate this result, we must also consider its value to those it was meant to help. Looking ahead, a capable response to future epidemics in West Africa will require both vaccines and sustained commitments to public health infrastructure.</description>

      <description>[EDIT 2.1.16 - I had the chance to look back on this. While this post is a hopeful one, it also reflects a kind of naivet√© about NGOs and their role in development.]

Besides the frequent foreigner mistakes, the last three weeks of living here have been rather peaceful. When eight people live together in a two-bedroom house, privacy is fiction.</description>
